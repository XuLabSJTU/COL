Description: COL aims to identify putatively functional back-splicing based on the molecular error hypothesis.COL combined (1) substantially higher back-splicing rates than expected from the total splicing amounts; (2) conserved splicing motifs between different species; (3) high back-splicing levels to identify functional back-splicing.COL has been proved to be very effective on identifying shared back-splicing junctions and experimentally functional back-splicing junctions.
